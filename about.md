# About

Aleph should support "Markdown pages", see [the docs](https://alephjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages), just like Next and Gatsby. 

However, so far it gives a 404 when navigating to /about.

It does not (yet) seem to support an automatic list of pages, so links must be added manually, in this case in AppTopBar.tsx.
