The second\npart (&quot;foo&quot;) is the salt and the third part (&quot;bar&quot;) is the hash from the password + salt.</p>\n<p>This article also shows that using the hash calculated from the salt and the password with openssl.\nThis is great, because know we can write a small script to try out many passwords without trying to login to SSH and\nbeing kicked out for too many failed responses. The command looks like this, with <code>-1</code> indicating md5, <code>foo</code> as the\nsalt and <code>secret</code> the actual password.</p>\n<p><code>openssl passwd -1 -salt foo secret # output: $1$foo$ygQElgzdVoe51UiGBN5TV/</code></p>\n<p>It is easy to do this in a bash script, but of course there already exists some open source tool: <a href="https://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a>\n(<a href="https://linuxconfig.org/password-cracking-with-john-the-ripper-on-linux">info on usage</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First run <code>sudo unshadow rootfs/etc/passwd rootfs/etc/shadow &gt; mypasswd.txt</code>\nwhere <code>unshadow</code> is a util from <code>john</code>.</li>\n<li>Now remove all the entries from mypasswd.txt except the root user.</li>\n<li>Now run <code>john mypasswd.txt --fork=4</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>fork</code> flag enables multi threading, in this case on 4 threads. While the command is running, I see that 4 out of 8 cores\nhave a 100% load. After approximately 7 hours a password is found. Please note, that the other threads keep running, but a nice overview\nis giving of how long the processes have been running and at what passwords they are trying.</p>\n<p>Logging in to SSH as root works! (So it was indeed the correct <code>sshd_config</code>).\nA prompt is shown with only &quot;#&quot;. Running <code>df -h</code> gives:</p>\n<pre class="language-autoit"><code class="language-autoit">Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n<span class="token

The $1 indicates MD5 hashing was used, which is notoriously easy to crack. The second\npart (&quot;foo&quot;) is the salt and the third part (&quot;bar&quot;) is the hash from the password + salt.</p>\n<p>This article also shows that using the hash calculated from the salt and the password with openssl.\nThis is great, because know we can write a small script to try out many passwords without trying to login to SSH and\nbeing kicked out for too many failed responses. The command looks like this, with <code>-1</code> indicating md5, <code>foo</code> as the\nsalt and <code>secret</code> the actual password.</p>\n<p><code>openssl passwd -1 -salt foo secret # output: $1$foo$ygQElgzdVoe51UiGBN5TV/</code></p>\n<p>It is easy to do this in a bash script, but of course there already exists some open source tool: <a href="https://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a>\n(<a href="https://linuxconfig.org/password-cracking-with-john-the-ripper-on-linux">info on usage</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First run <code>sudo unshadow rootfs/etc/passwd rootfs/etc/shadow &gt; mypasswd.txt</code>\nwhere <code>unshadow</code> is a util from <code>john</code>.</li>\n<li>Now remove all the entries from mypasswd.txt except the root user.</li>\n<li>Now run <code>john mypasswd.txt --fork=4</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>fork</code> flag enables multi threading, in this case on 4 threads. While the command is running, I see that 4 out of 8 cores\nhave a 100% load. After approximately 7 hours a password is found. Please note, that the other threads keep running, but a nice overview\nis giving of how long the processes have been running and at what passwords they are trying.</p>\n<p>Logging in to SSH as root works! (So it was indeed the correct <code>sshd_config</code>).\nA prompt is shown with only &quot;#&quot;. Running <code>df -h</code> gives:</p>\n<pre class="language-autoit"><code class="language-autoit">Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n<span class="token
