However,\nI have no idea what effect this would have on an OS, so I would prefer to refrain from modifying the filesystem at this\npoint. Additionally, assuming that the provided SD card image always uses the same root password, it would be valuable\nto know the password to be able to log into other devices.</p>\n<p>Another option would be to try to retrieve the password from the root entry in <code>/etc/shadow</code>. More information about\nwhy passwords are stored in <code>/etc/shadow</code> instead of <code>/etc/passwd</code> <a href="https://www.slashroot.in/how-are-passwords-stored-linux-understanding-hashing-shadow-utils">here</a>.</p>\n<p>From this article I also learned how to read the shadow file: the password entry (<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span>foo$bar) is in fact three\nproperties separated by $. The $1 indicates MD5 hashing was used, which is notoriously easy to crack. The second\npart (&quot;foo&quot;) is the salt and the third part (&quot;bar&quot;) is the hash from the password + salt.</p>\n<p>This article also shows that using the hash calculated from the salt and the password with openssl.\nThis is great, because know we can write a small script to try out many passwords without trying to login to SSH and\nbeing kicked out for too many failed responses. The command looks like this, with <code>-1</code> indicating md5, <code>foo</code> as the\nsalt and <code>secret</code> the actual password.</p>\n<p><code>openssl passwd -1 -salt foo secret # output: $1$foo$ygQElgzdVoe51UiGBN5TV/</code></p>\n<p>It is easy to do this in a bash script, but of course there already exists some open source tool: <a href="https://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a>\n(<a href="https://linuxconfig.org/password-cracking-with-john-the-ripper-on-linux">info on usage</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First run <code>sudo unshadow rootfs/etc/passwd rootfs/etc/shadow &gt; mypasswd.txt</code>\nwhere <code>unshadow</code> is a util from <code>john</code>.</li>\n<li>Now remove all the entries from mypasswd.txt except the root user.</li>\n<li>Now run <code>john mypasswd.txt --fork=4</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>fork</code> flag enables multi threading, in this case on 4 threads. While the command is running, I see that 4 out of 8 cores\nhave a 100% load. After approximately 7 hours a password is found. Please note, that the other threads keep running, but a nice overview\nis giving of how long the processes have been running and at what passwords they are trying.</p>\n<p>Logging in to SSH as root works! (So it was indeed the correct <code>sshd_config</code>).\nA prompt is shown with only &quot;#&quot;. Running <code>df -h</code> gives:</p>\n<pre class="language-autoit"><code class="language-autoit">Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n<span class="token

The $1 indicates MD5 hashing was used, which is notoriously easy to crack. The second\npart (&quot;foo&quot;) is the salt and the third part (&quot;bar&quot;) is the hash from the password + salt.</p>\n<p>This article also shows that using the hash calculated from the salt and the password with openssl.\nThis is great, because know we can write a small script to try out many passwords without trying to login to SSH and\nbeing kicked out for too many failed responses. The command looks like this, with <code>-1</code> indicating md5, <code>foo</code> as the\nsalt and <code>secret</code> the actual password.</p>\n<p><code>openssl passwd -1 -salt foo secret # output: $1$foo$ygQElgzdVoe51UiGBN5TV/</code></p>\n<p>It is easy to do this in a bash script, but of course there already exists some open source tool: <a href="https://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a>\n(<a href="https://linuxconfig.org/password-cracking-with-john-the-ripper-on-linux">info on usage</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First run <code>sudo unshadow rootfs/etc/passwd rootfs/etc/shadow &gt; mypasswd.txt</code>\nwhere <code>unshadow</code> is a util from <code>john</code>.</li>\n<li>Now remove all the entries from mypasswd.txt except the root user.</li>\n<li>Now run <code>john mypasswd.txt --fork=4</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>fork</code> flag enables multi threading, in this case on 4 threads. While the command is running, I see that 4 out of 8 cores\nhave a 100% load. After approximately 7 hours a password is found. Please note, that the other threads keep running, but a nice overview\nis giving of how long the processes have been running and at what passwords they are trying.</p>\n<p>Logging in to SSH as root works! (So it was indeed the correct <code>sshd_config</code>).\nA prompt is shown with only &quot;#&quot;. Running <code>df -h</code> gives:</p>\n<pre class="language-autoit"><code class="language-autoit">Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n<span class="token
